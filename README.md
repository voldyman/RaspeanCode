#Raspberry Pi Workshop

I attented a workshop on Raspberry Pi at IIT Roorkee conducted by [Inventrom](http://inventrom.com). These are some of the code files we wrote there. 

[ there were more but they were a general introduction to python, if you want to learn python then please go [here](http://learnpythonthehardway.com) ]

##Libraries Used
* [**Requests**](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/): *Requests is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings.*

* [**BeautifulSoup**](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/): *Beautiful Soup is a Python library designed for quick turnaround projects like screen-scraping.*

* **RPi.GPIO**: *A library to control the GPIO pins on Raspberry Pi*

##Usage
Most of these files run out-of-the-box you'll just need to edit the email-notifier.py and tweeter.py to add authentication values.

Run Them Using:

     $ sudo python <file_name.py>
